Where's Schueller?

Here is one of the visualizatons I used in a project looking at the location of Professor Schueller. In this study, I aimed to explore the frequency of data points recorded between 10 PM and 6 AM. My hypothesis suggested that nighttime data points would not exhibit a distinct pattern, as the recordings are likely to be random in nature during these hours.

Finding: The trend shows a general decrease in the average number of data points recorded overnight from 2013 to 2024. The highest average was recorded in 2013 (364.75), while the lowest was in 2024 (144.32).
